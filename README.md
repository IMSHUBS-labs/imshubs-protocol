# IMSHUBS Protocol

> A decentralized, non-custodial protocol for sovereign commerce.

IMSHUBS provides the foundational smart contracts for escrow, reputation, and listings, enabling anyone to build uncensorable, peer-to-peer marketplaces.

## 🚧 Status: Active Development

**Current Phase:** Protocol architecture finalization and team formation.
*   We are currently recruiting a Lead Solidity Developer.
*   Core smart contracts are in the planning phase.
*   Follow our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UQkSV7xhTT) for development updates.

## 🧩 Core Components

*   **Non-Custodial Escrow:** (`Escrow.sol`) - Secure, trustless payment handling.
*   **Portable On-Chain Reputation:** (`Reputation.sol`) - User-owned reputation across all dApps built on IMSHUBS.
*   **Censorship-Resistant Listings:** (`ListingFactory.sol`) - Listings stored on IPFS/Arweave.

## 🛠️ For Developers

This repository will soon contain:
*   Audited, production-ready Solidity smart contracts.
*   Comprehensive documentation and guides.
*   A JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for easy integration.
*   Deployment scripts for Ethereum L2 testnets and mainnets.
